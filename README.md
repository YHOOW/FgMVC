This work is inspired by K-Multiple-Means: A Multiple-Means Clustering Method with Specified K Clusters (KDD2019).   
The updateC.m and pdist2.m functions are derived from the open source code of Multi-View k-means Clustering with AdaptiveSparse Memberships and Weight Allocation (TKDE2020). 

# Short demo
main.m: you can run this main file, and its performance will be recorded automatically. 

# Parameters: 
k_nearest: Number of neighbors

M_subcluster: Number of subclusters

If you want to obtain clustering results for other datasets, you need to set these two parameters.
